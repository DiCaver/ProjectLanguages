# ProjectLanguages

A Python script that will scan the root directory and all subdirectories for files and then print out the file extension and the percentage of files that have that extension.

## Description

Python script that you didn't know that you need it ðŸ˜‰ One of the best (for me!) features GitHub have been that small Language info. Was searching how to get this info from projects that I don't have in GitHub. This script is the result because I couldn't find anything simple.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Run and tested on Windows 11 with Python 3.9.6. It uses only os library (import os).

### Executing program

Put ProjectLanguages.py into the root folder of your project (or whatever) and run it.
