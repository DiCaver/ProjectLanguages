# ProjectLanguages
A Python script that will scan the root directory and all subdirectories for files and then print out the file extension and the percentage of files that have that extension.

Always loved [this](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode#:~:text=%2B%201%2C740%20contributors-,Languages,-TypeScript) Languages bar next to the repository. So I made one for projects that aren't on GitHub...
